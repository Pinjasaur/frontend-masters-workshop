PB is a grumpy old man, his words

> "Passive income is a fantasy!"

> 90% of startups fail

Why SaaS app fail
- No real problem: struggle to solve a meaningful problem
- Poor marketing: acquire _and_ retain customers
- No differentiation: need to differ from others

It _can_ be worth it!
- Escape the 9&ndash;5
- Escape bosses & clients
- Escape hourly ceiling e.g. income cap
- Additional revenue stream

> Success _is_ possible **with** careful planning _and_ avoiding impulsive
> actions.

There are _exceptions_
- For fun
- To learn
- To help out

_Before_ starting to code:

## Define (your MVP)

Why your MVP matters
- Defines scope
- Reduces cost (not necessarily money, but time too)
- Aids in marketing

Steps for defining an MVP
1. Brainstorm possible tasks
1. Identify top tasks
1. Planning your launch features

### Brainstorm possible features

Look at competition
- What's there?
- What's coming?
- What's missing?

Be inspired by user research
- Requests
- Pain points
- Goals

Ask AI!

> I am trying to build a SaaS application for
> [audience] that enables them to [goal].
>
> So far, I have identified the following tasks users
> will need to complete:
>
> [tasks]
>
> What other tasks should I consider adding to the
> application to help users.

### Identify top tasks

Steps involved
1. Gather long list
1. Rationalize into something more manageable
1. Get users to vote on what matters the most
1. Analyze results

Top task analysis "lite"
1. Create survey (Tool: PollUnit)
1. Clean results (remove dupes, simplify wording)

AI can help.

After all this, the top 3rd of the list are the top tasks.

> "But, I don't have access to my users"

... then ...

> "You've got a big problem!"

If you don't have access to users to do a top task analysis, how would they
actually use the app you're building?

Places to look:
- Reddit
- Forums
- Mailing lists
- Social media
- Meetups
- Confs
- Quora
- Stack Overflow
- Slack

There are recruitment services
- Testing tools usually $1/person
- Tool mentioned: Askable

### Choosing launch features

Selecting
- Market fit
- Practicalities

Market fit
- Top tasks: what features to users want the most?
- Value prop
- Competition
- Impact

Practicalities
- Easy to build
- Scalability

For each feature, create user stories

- As a _
- I want to _
- So that I can _

Do _not_ build, prototype.

3 reasons to prototype
- Save effort
- Faster to market
- Plan for future

Start with wireframes

Then, hi-fi mockups for critical screens

What you want to learn
- Do they like it?
- Do they get it?
- Can they use it?

Test with something like Lyssna:
- **Do they like it**: semantic differential survey (what words associated)
- **Do they get it**: 5-second test (what was recalled)
- **Can they use it**: first-click testing (initial click in the interface)

> "Should you create an interactive prototype for thorough testing?"

Yes, but not now. You don't know if people would buy your app.

In conclusion:
- MVP is indispensible
- Brainstorm all tasks
- Identity top tasks
- What is practical to launch with?
- Prototype before building

## Test (via a marketing campaign)

Fake it 'til ya make it kind of scenario. Smoke & mirrors.

What you will learn from a campaign
- Acquisition: can we get peoples attention?
- Conversion: try and narrow in on conversion rate
- Pricing: make pricing decisions

Steps in running a campaign
1. Define success
1. Set your price
1. Build a landing page
1. Drive traffic
1. Nurture audience


### Defining success

The "stay informed" approach
- Doesn't indicate whether they're willing to buy
- Provides opportunity to nurture the lead

The "waiting list" approach
- Creates sense of demand
- Still allows nurturing leads

The "fake order" approach
- Fake buy button
- More accurate buying experience
- May alienate users

The "preorder" approach
- e.g. Gumroad has this functionality
- Preorder product for a heavy discount
- Offers actual buying experience, w/ lower levels

What about crowdfunding?

Likely not reliable test for long-term viability.

### Pricing

Freemium
- Good for user acquisition
- Difficult to convert

Subscription
- Predictable revenue
- Unpredictable revenue e.g. billing

Usage-based
- Fair to users; direct relationship of cost & value
- Continuously need to provide value to prevent churn

Per-user (common in B2B)
- Easy to understand and scales with size of team
- Can discourage adoption in large teams / orgs

Feature-based
- Can pick a plan to fit needs & budget
- Can be difficult to grok what features at what tier

Hybrid
- Flexibility
- Complex to communicate & manage

Pricing factors to consider
- Audience: how much are people willing to pay?
- Competition: how are others doing it?
- Flexibility: discounts or change over time?
- Costs: do you need a minimum customer base?

### Building a landing page

Value prop
- Strapline: summarize app in single sentence
- Benefits: list how app helps e.g. goals & pain points
- Features: list of features

Calls to action
- primary e.g. preorder
- secondary e.g. sign up for updates

Objections
- sell email?
- bad app?
- hard to unsub?
- too many emails?
- pressure into buying?
- get hacked?

Exit intent survey?

Social proof
- reviews & ratings
- testimonials
- simple naming of high profile customers
- celebrity endorsement
- 3rd party accreditation
- industry awards
- positive press coverage

Content blocks
- each benefit
- each feature
- each social proof
- add objections into existing content blocks

Improve content quality w/ Hemingway app

Page flow
1. Summary
1. Call to action
1. Social proof
1. Benefits
1. Call to action

Aesthetics (idk, good luck, have fun)

Test your landing page
- 5s test
- first-click test
- semantic differential survey
- eye-tracking simulation

### Drive traffic

Community engagement
- All the places from before (forums, lists, groups, where the people are)

What about Product Hunt?
- tends to favor apps w/ broad appeal
- doesn't address the issue of generating traffic long-term

Content marketing
- Blogging: guest blog elsewhere (get them backlinks baby)
- Podcasts: appear as a guest
- Social: pain points, questions, goals (backlink in bio)

Paid acquisition
- Paid (sponsored) posts
- Search ads (pay-per-click)
- Social ads

### Nurture your audience

- Onboarding emails
- Progress updates
- Feature suggestions (PollUnit)
- Early access

In conclusion:
1. Define success
1. Set your price
1. Build landing pages
1. Drive traffic
1. Nurture audience
