The _good_ part (of the web) is also the _bad_ part. The web is _weird_.

The Real Worldâ„¢ is all about trade-offs.

> &ldquo;We had to do `$thing` in order to get `$feature` working&rdquo;&mdash;Famous last words

If you're doing it well, then no one notices your hard work.

> &ldquo;I don't need to learn about web sec, `$framework` handles it for me&rdquo;&mdash;Famous last words

We'll talk about:
- Common vulnerabilities (vulnz) in web apps
- Exploiting vulnz
- Reasonable understanding of client & server tools
- Trade-offs: security, UX, complexity (of infra)

On the Internet, you can be _anyone_.

### Cookies

Small bits of data stored on the client to track & identify users.

HTTP is stateless, cookies implement sessions.

Cookies were originally implemented fast & loose.

Until 2011 there was no spec.

RFC6265: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265

HTTP Header:

```
Cookie: username=bobbytables;

  ^        ^          ^
Header    Key       Value
```

JS API: `document.cookie`

`Expires` and `Max-Age`. Without any expiration, cookies last the session
duration.

You can't technically delete cookies, but you _can_ set an expiration date in
the _past_.

You can scope cookies to:
- Path: generally unreliable (pre-dates specs, many iframe haxxx)
- Domain

TIL: the GitHub Desktop can install `github` to your CLI which is real handy.

### Same Origin Policy

Origin is protocol + domain + port.

Ways around it:
- CORS
- JSONP
- Proxies
- PostMessage API
- WebSockets
- `document.domain`

### Cookie Vulnz

- Session hijacking
- XSS
- CSRF

### Privilege Escalation

- Initial access: limited access
- Discovering weakness: identify misconfigs or vulnz
- Exploiting vulns: leverage for higher privileges
- Gaining control: access sensitive data or exec unauthorized actions

Site != Origin

Different origins could be the same site, but different sites are always different origins.

TIL `sec-` prefixed headers cannot be tampered with by JS

"Safe sinks" are places the browser promises not to execute e.g. `$el.textContent`

### JSON Web Tokens

Scale better vs sessions e.g. no need for looking up sessions

Pref to store as Cookie > Session Storage > Local Storage (also in memory but...)
